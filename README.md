This project is a work in progress from a student of STRV's React Nights.

## Project starter

As a project starter create-react-app was used, since it's well documented and thoroughly tested. As a downside, there's no hot module replacement, but is can be easily added (see index.js). 

## APIs

For APIs we will rely on [commercelayer.io](https://commercelayer.io/), which provides headless REST APIs with a free testing version.
